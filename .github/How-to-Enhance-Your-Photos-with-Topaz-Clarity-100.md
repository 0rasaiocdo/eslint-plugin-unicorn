## What is Topaz Clarity?
 
Topaz Clarity is a dedicated contrast enhancing software program that uses intelligent algorithms to analyze your image and apply the optimal amount of contrast to each part of it. Unlike other contrast tools that apply global adjustments and often cause halos or artifacts, Topaz Clarity divides your image into micro-contrast regions and adjusts them separately, preserving the natural look and detail of your photo.
 
Topaz Clarity also offers a variety of presets that you can use to quickly apply different styles and effects to your image. You can choose from categories such as Landscape, Portrait, Architecture, Fashion, Macro, and more. You can also customize the presets or create your own by adjusting the sliders for clarity, tone, hue, saturation, and luminance.
